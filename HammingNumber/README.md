# Hamming Number

## Task

Write a function that computes the nth smallest Hamming Number

A Hamming number is a positive integer of the form 2i3j5k, for some non-negative integers i, j, and k.

## Examples
```
The first smallest Hamming number is 1 = 2^0*3^0*5^0
The second smallest Hamming number is 2 = 2^1*3^0*5^0
The third smallest Hamming number is 3 = 2^0*3^1*5^0
The fourth smallest Hamming number is 4 = 2^2*3^0*5^0
The fifth smallest Hamming number is 5 = 2^0*3^0*5^1
```

## Additional Information
N will always be greater than 0
